# A Client-Server Chat Progarm

### How to use:

#### Setup.py:

Running the Server:

```shell
python3 Setup.py
```

When you run the Setup.py it automatically gets the computer's IP and sets the port to 5000 as default, which can be changed in the Setup.py file on line 12. A Client will automatically open locally and connect to the Server.

#### Run_Client.py:

Running the GUI:

```shell
python3 Run_Client.py
```

This will open a pop-up to ask for the IP and port of the server.
